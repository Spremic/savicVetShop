          manufacturing variations, supplier changes, or other factors beyond our 
          control. You will receive a similar product that matches the product 
          description, but we make no warranty that it will be exactly as depicted

          or the Website shall be governed by and construed in accordance with

          regard to its conflict of law provisions.
        </p>

        <h2>7.2 Jurisdiction and Venue</h2>
        <p>

          Before filing any formal legal proceeding, you agree to first contact 
          us to attempt to resolve the dispute informally. If we cannot resolve 
          the dispute within 60 days, you agree to resolve the dispute through 
          binding arbitration as described below.
        </p>

        <h2>7.4 Binding Arbitration</h2>
        <p>

        <p>
          YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND WE 
          ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE 
          IN A CLASS ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, OR CONSOLIDATED PROCEEDING.
        </p>

        <h2>7.5 Exceptions to Arbitration</h2>

        <p>
          YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN 
          YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER 
          IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. 
          FURTHERMORE, UNLESS BOTH YOU AND WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY 
          NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE 
          PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING.
        </p>

        <h2>7.7 Statute of Limitations</h2>
